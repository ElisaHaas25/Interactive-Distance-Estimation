# Interactive-Distance-Estimation
The Jupyter Notebook "Interactive Distance Estimation.ipynb" can be used to plot different prior models as well as their respective posteriors and estimated distances and distance errors. 

First you choose your model. There currently are three options:

1. GGD: uses generalized gamma distribution as prior
2. EDSD: uses exponentially decreasing density distribution as prior
3. Photogeometric: uses combination of GGD prior and information on colour and apparent magnitude
